# Assorted Commentary

This boilerplate isn't for beginners since it assumes some level of familiarity.

If you're a beginner, Will Vincent's [books](https://learndjango.com/books/) are likely your best bet in understanding Django better. He uses class-based views for his examples so this might be appreciated further by diving into [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_urls/). Also note django tips by [Thomas GÃ¼ttler](https://github.com/guettli/django-tips).

!!! note "Notable criticisms of Django"

    The comments on HackerNews are often dismissive of Django in an Age of Javascript.

    The following articles, to me, provide better context on the general criticism of Django:

    1. [In Defense of Crusty Old Swiss Army Knives](https://zachgoldstein.engineering/posts/crusty-knives/crusty-knives/)
    2. [authentik on Django: 500% slower to run but 200% faster to build](https://goauthentik.io/blog/2023-03-16-authentik-on-django-500-slower-to-run-but-200-faster-to-build)

    `tl;dr`: Django predates many, still capable. Enter Thor meme: "still worthy".
